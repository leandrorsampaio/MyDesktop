Congratulations. quite well done\n \nAs a gut feeling, seems quite good. Im not sure what you mean by \"md\" in the component injection but seems a fair value. The only thing you should be aware is that advic thing usually has a lot of bugs. And they take forever to fix. \n \nBut then is not your problem, just that this might delay some of the process. \n \nBut if I were you I would add a new row \"communication\" and add some 20% ovr it. Just to be in the safe side. The you could have 40 hours for example, you would have 1 week to finish (or 2 in your new 50% contract)\n \nlet me know if I can help you in anything else.",
